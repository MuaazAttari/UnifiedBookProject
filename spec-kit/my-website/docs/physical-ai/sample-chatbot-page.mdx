# Sample Page with Chatbot

This is a sample page demonstrating how the chatbot can be integrated into Docusaurus pages.

import ChatInterface from '@site/src/components/Chatbot';

## Interactive Textbook Assistant

You can ask questions about this content using the real-time chatbot below:

<ChatInterface contextType="full_book" chapterTitle="Sample Chapter" />

## Selected Text Context

If you have selected text on a page, the chatbot will automatically detect it and switch to selected text context mode. You can also pass specific text like this:

<ChatInterface
  contextType="selected_text"
  selectedText="This is an example of selected text that would be passed to the chatbot for context-aware responses."
  chapterTitle="Sample Chapter"
/>

## How It Works

The chatbot component allows users to ask questions about the textbook content. It supports two context modes:

- **Full Book**: Answers questions based on the entire textbook content
- **Selected Text**: Answers questions based on specific selected text

The component handles API communication with the backend RAG service and displays responses with source information.
