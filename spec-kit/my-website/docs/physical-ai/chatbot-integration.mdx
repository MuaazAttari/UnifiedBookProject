# Chatbot Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate the textbook chatbot into Docusaurus pages for interactive learning experiences.

## Basic Integration

To add the chatbot to any MDX page, simply import and include the component:

```mdx
import ChatInterface from '@site/src/components/Chatbot';

<ChatInterface contextType="full_book" chapterTitle="Your Chapter Title" />
```

## Context Modes

The chatbot supports two context modes:

### Full Book Context
```mdx
<ChatInterface contextType="full_book" chapterTitle="Introduction to AI" />
```

In this mode, the chatbot answers questions based on the entire textbook content.

### Selected Text Context
```mdx
<ChatInterface
  contextType="selected_text"
  selectedText="The specific text that was selected by the user"
  chapterTitle="Introduction to AI"
/>
```

In this mode, the chatbot answers questions based on specific selected text.

## Smart Chat Interface

For automatic text selection detection, use the smart interface:

```mdx
import ChatInterface from '@site/src/components/Chatbot';

<ChatInterface contextType="full_book" chapterTitle="Introduction to AI" />
```

This component automatically detects when text is selected on the page and switches to selected text context mode.

## Features

- **Context Awareness**: Switches between full book and selected text contexts
- **Source Attribution**: Shows sources for answers
- **Confidence Scoring**: Displays confidence level for responses
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Real-time Interaction**: Fast response times

## Usage Tips

1. Always provide a relevant `chapterTitle` for better context
2. Use `contextType="full_book"` as the default for general questions
3. The smart interface will automatically switch to selected text mode when text is highlighted
4. Press `Escape` to clear the current selection

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of a page with integrated chatbot:

```mdx
---
title: Chapter 1 - Introduction
---

# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Physical AI

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI...

import ChatInterface from '@site/src/components/Chatbot';

## Ask Questions

<ChatInterface
  contextType="full_book"
  chapterTitle="Chapter 1 - Introduction to Physical AI"
/>
```

The chatbot will appear below the content and allow users to ask questions about the material.
