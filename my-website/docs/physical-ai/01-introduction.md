# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Physical AI represents a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence that emphasizes the importance of physical embodiment in creating truly intelligent systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI leverages the interaction between intelligence and physical form to create more adaptive, robust, and human-compatible systems.

Humanoid robotics takes this concept further by creating machines that not only think and act but also share human-like form and capabilities. This convergence of AI and robotics promises to transform industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to personal assistance and exploration.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive textbook will guide you through the fascinating world of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, covering:
